This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## YouTube App

I want to build more React apps and followed a quick tutorial using the YouTube API.

### Tutorial Source

You can find the [React YouTube API Tutorial](https://rapidapi.com/blog/react-youtube-api/) here.
You can find the [YouTube API](https://rapidapi.com/marindelija/api/youtube-search-results) here.

### Limit on HTTP calls

Please note that this is built with a basic plan with YouTube API in RapidAPI.
HTTP calls are limited to 100 calls/day, not exceeding 10 calls per minute.
